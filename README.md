# ScanSlated-Portal
Mock up user portal for ScanSlated, API and Front end included in one repo  

# Notes:  

- I began building this app with React and Python but it has been a while since I've worked with React, and for the sake of time I'll be rebuilding with pure django and django templates.  
- I've now wasted far too much time starting and rebuilding. This will be my final rebuild and there is no going back. Treat this as sort of a "speed coding contest" for the next few days.

# Things left to do  
- minor tweaks to profile info
- remove demo link
- customize admin
- dockerize
- deploy
- screenshot
- add to portfolio
- email Yianni
- customize portfolio text

Things I wish I could have done:
- add phone number to user model
- add email and text alerts for reports
- settings page to change alerts
- Dr. Profiles
- Dr./Patient code authentication to "unlock" reports
- More/better styling
- More API/FrontEnd format
- Spend more time on everything...
